# MonkeMaze
Explore randomly generated mazes with your friends in Gorilla Tag and find secrets along the way.

## Exploring the maze
To enter the maze, walk through the tunnel (either while not in a room or while in the Monke Maze gamemode) and a randomly generated maze will await you and your friends. Find the relic to leave the maze and don't get lost! You have a compass to guide you but you'll have to stay sharp and avoid the fake paths. Once you are done, enter a new room or leave and rejoin to reset the maze's seed.
